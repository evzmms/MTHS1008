    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = 0.$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\cos x = x,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "do not have simple solutions of the form we are used to being able to find at school.  However, we can define in this case $f(x) = \\cos x - x$ and look for a solution of $f(x)=0$ using the methods we shall implement below. [Spoiler alert: $x$ is about 0.7391 for this equation!]\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical engineering applications we are frequently confronted with equations of the form $f(x) = 0$ that we need to solve, but no formula for their solution exists.  In this notebook we will implement a strategy for solving these types of equation known as the **method of bisection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The method of bisection\n",
    "\n",
    "We are seeking the special value of $x$ that satisfies $f(x)=0$.  Our strategy is to trap this special value of $x$ between to endpoints, let's call them $x_L$ and $x_R$, and then systematically move our endpoints closer and closer to each other ensuring that $x$ remains trapped between the endpoints.  When our endpoints are sufficiently close to each other, say within a tolerance of $10^{-6}$ then we have a numerical approximation to the solution of our equation that is accurate to 6 decimal places, for example, and we can stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trapping the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to provide two endpoints to use our method; $x_L$ and $x_R$, where $x_L$ is less than the true solution $x$ and $x_R$ is greater than the true solution $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "![texte](Slide1_crop.png)\n",
    "$$\\textbf{Figure 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see in Figure 1 above the curve $y = f(x)$.  The solution of our problem, or desired \"root\", is the special value of $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$, this is indicated by the blue circle on $y = 0$.  The endpoint $x_L$ is less than the root and we can see that $f(x_L)<0$;  $x_L$ is a lower estimate for the desired root.  The endpoint $x_R$ is greater than the root and we can see that $f(x_R)>0$; $x_R$ is an upper estimate for the desired root.  It is *essential* that the root lies inbetween the two endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the method to work we must ensure that $f(x_L)$ and $f(x_R)$ have opposite signs.  It does not matter whether $f(x_L)<0$ and $f(x_R)>0$, as shown in Figure 1, or $f(x_L)>0$ and $f(x_R)<0$.  But before we begin we must ensure that the condition $f(x_L)f(x_R) < 0$ is satisfied as this guarantees that $f(x_L)$ and $f(x_R)$ have different signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that we have chosen two suitable values of $x_L$ and $x_R$ so that we can begin our method.\n",

    "$$\\textbf{Figure 2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Calculate the midpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "     We calculate the *midpoint* between $x_L$ and $x_R$ using\n",
    "    $$x_M = \\frac{x_L + x_R}{2}.$$\n",
    "    The midpoint is exactly halfway between $x_L$ and $x_R$, bisecting our endpoints - hence the name of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The midpoint of the values of $x_L$ and $x_R$ in Figure 1 has been calculated and plotted in Figure 2.  We can immediately see that the midpoint value $x_M$ is a much better *lower estimate* of the desired root than $x_L$.  So we can redefine our lower limit $x_L$ as being equal to the midpoint value $x_M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Observing that $x_M$ is a much better lower estimate than $x_L$ is straightforward from looking at Figure 2 - but how do we get Python to work out that it is the lower estimate that is improved and not the upper estimate?  If we replace the upper limit $x_R$ with the midpoint then we would no-longer be trapping our solution and the method would fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We see that it is the lower limit that gets updated in this case since $f(x_M)$ has the *same sign* as $f(x_L)$.  This means that both $x_M$ and $x_L$ are the same side of the desired root.  If $f(x_M)$ had been positive (in the case illustrated) then we would have updated the upper estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To implement this idea we first find out whether $f(x_L)f(x_M)$ is greater than 0 or not using\n",
    "\n",
    "        If f(XL) * f(XM) > 0: \n",
    "\n",
    "    `If` this is true then $x_L$ and $x_M$ are the same side of the root and we update the lower estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "            XL = XM\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `else` $x_L$ and $x_M$ are opposite sides of the root and we update the upper estimate\n",

    "        \n",
    "- Step 2 Use the midpoint to narrow the distance between the endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So for the illustrated case we update the lower estimate, setting it equal to the midpoint\n",

    "$$\\textbf{Figure 3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we go back to Step 1 and recalculate the midpoint based on our new endpoint.  This is shown in Figure 3.  The original lower estimate is shown in light blue, our new updated lower estimate is at $x_L$ and we have a new midpoint, $x_M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we see that $f(x_M)>0$ meaning that for the case shown $f(x_L)$ and $f(x_M)$ have opposite signs and that therefore the desired root is trapped between $x_L$ and $x_M$.  We have that $x_M$ is an improved upper estimate of the desired root and so in Step 2 we update $x_R$ by setting $x_R = x_M$.\n",

    "\n",
    "As can be seen from Figure 4, when we go back to Step 1 and recalculate the midpoint we now have a very good estimate of our desired root.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep iterating around Steps 1 and 2 until our numerical solution is accurate enough for our application.  We know that our root is always trapped between $x_L$ and $x_R$, so if the distance between $x_L$ and $x_R$ is less than a given tolerance that we can specify then we know our solution is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that NASA landed on the Moon working to six decimal places, so we don't need millions and millions of decimal places for most applications.  We can terminate our iterative process when\n",
