    "\n",
    "- An industrial batch process is manufacturing Iron Sulphide (FeS) in $100\\,$kg batches\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A mixture of sulphur powder and iron filings is heated to manufacture the target product\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A fault has developed in the plant which has led to an incomplete reaction\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- The specification of the initial mixture is that it is a total of $100\\,$kg with 36.4\\% sulphur powder and 63.6\\% iron filings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a result of some of the sulphur vapourising we have a waste mixture that is 32.7\\% sulphur and 67.3\\% iron filings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have available a sulphur-rich mixture that is 83.4\\% sulphur powder and 16.6\\% iron filings\n",
    "\n",
    "    **How much of the waste mixture and of the sulphur-rich mixture do we need in order to make a $100\\,$kg batch at the specified target ratio?**"
