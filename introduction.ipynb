    "## Introduction \n",
    "- A computer program is a set of “statements” that a computer blindly follows\n",
    "\n",
    "- An “algorithm” is a set of statements designed to solve a particular problem, e.g., find the solution of a quadratic, or find a square root etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are different “languages” that can be used to write a program in (e.g., C++, Perl, Java, Julia, Fortran etc.).  We will be using Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each computer system (e.g., Windows, Mac, UNIX) “interprets” the language for its own CPU, we will not need to worry (largely)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is in a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A computer can carry out basic mathematical operations (+, -, ×, ÷)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A computer can store numbers in named areas of its memory\n",
    "\n",
    "- A computer can test a logical statement to see if it is true (slow)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A computer can loop (recursively execute) statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test everything\n",

    "We can perform basic calculations in Python just as on a basic calculator.  Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division behave (largely) as you would expect"
