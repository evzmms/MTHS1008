    "### Motivation \n",
    "•\tBasic computer programming competence required for all jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSolve problems that do not have simple mathematical solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "•\tA computer program is a set of “statements” that a computer blindly follows\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAn “algorithm” is a set of statements designed to solve a particular problem, e.g., find the solution of a quadratic, or find a square root etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tThere are different “languages” that can be used to write a program in (e.g., C++, Perl, Java, Julia, Fortran etc.).  We will be using Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tEach computer system (e.g., Windows, Mac, UNIX) “interprets” the language for its own CPU, we will not need to worry (largely)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is in a program\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA computer can carry out basic mathematical operations (+, -, ×, ÷)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA computer can store numbers in named areas of its memory\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA computer can test a logical statement to see if it is true (slow)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tA computer can loop (recursively execute) statements\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tTest everything\n",

    "## Simple Calculations\n",
    "We can perform basic calculations in Python just as on a basic calculator.  Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division behave (largely) as you would expect"
